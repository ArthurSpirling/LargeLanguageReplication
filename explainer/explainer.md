# Replication for Language Models: Non-Technical Explainer

Our paper has some technical parts, but the basic argument---and our evidence for that argument---is  simple. Here we give a non-technical account of our project, the questions we answer and how we go about doing that.  The intended audience is social scientists who are interested in "AI" for their research tasks, but who perhaps have less training in using language models than they would like. Below each section you will find a "too long, didn't read" summary. 

## 1. Replication: what it means and what it is for
