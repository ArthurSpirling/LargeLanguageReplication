# Replication for Language Models: Non-Technical Explainer

Our paper has some technical parts, but the basic argument---and our evidence for that argument---is  simple. Here we give a non-technical account of our project, the questions we answer and how we go about doing that.  The intended audience is social scientists who are interested in "AI" for their research tasks, but who perhaps have less training in using language models than they would like. Below each section you will find a "too long, didn't read" summary. 

## 1. Replication: what it means and what it is for

At most top scholarly journals today, when a researcher has a paper accepted, they must deposit "replication" or "verification" materials.  For quantitative researchers, this is the data and code they used to produce the results in their paper.  Whole infrastructures have grown up to support this practice. These include the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/) and software services like [Codeocean](https://codeocean.com/).  At some journals, the requirement is much more stringent than simply *providing* these items. At the [AJPS](https://ajps.org/ajps-verification-policy/), for example, a third party (i.e. not the authors themselves) will take those materials and they  

> will be verified to confirm that they do, in fact, reproduce the analytic results reported in the article. Publication in the American Journal of Political Science is contingent upon provision of complete verification materials and successful verification of their content.

At a high level, such practices contribute to "research transparency".  This is the idea that we can see what authors did, and check they *really* did it.  In a narrow sense, it prevents fraud.  But it is much broader in spirit: it allows future researchers a useful starting point for building on prior efforts, including checking how different assumptions or methods might affect the robustness of the published results. It also encourages authors depositing such materials to "get it right" first time (i.e. to double-check their code actually does what they say it does).
