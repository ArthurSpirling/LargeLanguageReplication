# Replication for Language Models: Non-Technical Explainer

Our paper has some technical parts, but the basic argument---and our evidence for that argument---is  simple. Here we give a non-technical account of our project, the questions we answer and how we go about doing that.  The intended audience is social scientists who are interested in "AI" for their research tasks, but who perhaps have less training in using language models than they would like. Below each section you will find a "too long, didn't read" summary. 

## 1. Replication: what it means and what it is for

At most top scholarly journals today, when a researcher has a paper accepted, they must deposit "replication" or "verification" materials.  For quantitative researchers, this is the data and code they used to produce the results in their paper.  Whole infrastructures have grown up to support this practice. These include the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/) and software services like [Codeocean](https://codeocean.com/).  At some journals, the requirement is much more stringent than simply *providing* these items. At the [AJPS](https://ajps.org/ajps-verification-policy/), for example, a third party (i.e. not the authors themselves) will take those materials and they  

> will be verified to confirm that they do, in fact, reproduce the analytic results reported in the article. Publication in the American Journal of Political Science is contingent upon provision of complete verification materials and successful verification of their content.

At a high level, such practices contribute to "research transparency".  This is the idea that we can read what the authors said they did, and check they *really* did it.  In a narrow sense, it prevents fraud or terrible errors.  But it is much broader in spirit: it allows future researchers a useful starting point for building on prior efforts, including checking how different assumptions or methods might affect the robustness of the published results. It also encourages authors depositing such materials to "get it right" first time (i.e. to double-check their code actually does what they say it does). 

At this point, it's helpful to clarify a very confusing definitional issue.  In our paper, and in this explainer, we are focused on **replication** which we define as the idea that

> a scholar can take the materials from a given paper—its exact data, programming code, information on the operating system and environment used—and produce the same results as were reported in *that* paper.

This is how grad students in political science are [taught](https://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/replication.pdf) to use the term.  

This is different to *reproducibility* which, as we use that term, means taking the same broad procedures of the original study to a new or independent dataset and seeing to what extent the original findings hold up.  The problem is that different fields use these terms in exactly opposite ways. So when, for example colleagues discuss the "[replication crisis](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/replication-crisis)" in Psychology, they are concerned about the inability to "reproduce" (in our terms) major results from the past today.

**tl;dr: replication---the idea that you can take published work's data and code and verify you get the same result as the original author---is a vital part of today's quantitative social science practice. It is central to research transparency.**

## 2. The state of replication for Language Models (isn't good)

Given that we have norms around replication, and we provide both carrots (free data hosting) and sticks (journals require verification pre-publication), what is the problem to be solved? In brief it is that there has been an explosion of interest and use of a new technology called "[Large Language Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model)" in social science, but without commensurate attention to the complications that these methods create for replication.  Consequently, in our view, almost nothing using these models and being published today is "replicable" to anything like the standard we have come to demand and expect.
